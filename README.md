# Cargo-Quest
For my mobile app development class, I created a maze-based game in Android Studio using Java. This project culminated in roughly 8 to 10 weeks of work, during which I devised the idea and designed the project myself. The game is centered around a truck that needs to get to its cargo at the end of the maze. There are three different difficulty modes, whereas a round gets more difficult, the size of the maze grows. There are different vehicles and engine sounds to choose from, and all models, boxes, figures, and tiles were designed by me from scratch. Vehicles are animated in the game, and the animations and most sound effects were also done by me.

The project was designed in Android Studio while the program was written in Java. The use of XML was minimal, and all game objects were designed by hand. Overall, the project was a great experience that allowed me to create a fun game that I still have on my phone. Although it wasn’t as in-depth as I would’ve liked, it is still a fully functional game that can be played and enjoyed.


Here are some images of the game:
